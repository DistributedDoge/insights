# RPGF3 exploratory data analysis bounty

Bounty details: 

## Instructions

1. Checkout the CSV data. Each one is a list of timestamps for every commit, PR, issue made by an OSS project in the Gitcoin or Optimism ecosystem (many are in both!)
   
2. Checkout the python script. It reads the CSV data and manipulates it into a dataframe. Then it renders the data as a heatmap. Read https://banteg.xyz/posts/heatmap/ for more info on the heatmap.
   
3. Experiment with different modulations of the START_DATE and CMAP variables. You can see a complete list of colormaps here: https://cmasher.readthedocs.io/user/usage.html

4. Submit your best image as a PR to this repo. Include the START_DATE and CMAP settings you used to generate it.
