# GitHub Datashader Bounty 

Bounty details: https://www.bountycaster.xyz/bounty/0xd933e626dd268c2e444e80094802d857a7426d44

## Instructions

1. Checkout the CSV data. It contains a list of timestamps for every commit, PR, issue made by an OSS project in the Gitcoin ecosystem
   
2. Checkout the Python script. It reads the CSV data and manipulates it into a dataframe. Then it renders the data as a heatmap. Read https://banteg.xyz/posts/heatmap/ for more info on the heatmap.
   
3. Experiment with different modulations of the START_DATE and CMAP variables. You can see a complete list of colormaps [here](https://cmasher.readthedocs.io/user/usage.html). Feel free to experiment in other ways too!

4. Submit your best image as in [this warpcast](https://warpcast.com/cerv1/0xd933e626). Include the START_DATE and CMAP settings you used to generate it.
