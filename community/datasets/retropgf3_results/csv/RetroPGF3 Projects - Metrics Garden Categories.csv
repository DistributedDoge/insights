AP streamlines the process of constructing your own application infrastructure by offering an accessible toolset for developers. The framework incorporates a singleton smart contract design pattern, complemented by a minimalist yet performant indexing solution, along with a compact set of React hooks designed to integrate your frontend with the rest of the framework.
AP is catered towards developers unfamiliar with the challenges of creating high-performance Ethereum applications, as well as those who seek a straightforward, ready-to-use solution without the need to delve into the complexities of protocol design.

For each app, we've highlighted 3 to 5 of its most prominent features, along with a detailed overview, FAQs, social handles & links.

Our directory, segmented into 50+ categories, offers a built-in search engine, advanced filters, and sorting. It's extremely fast and user-friendly. We also have a blog that demystifies Optimism with ten in-depth and long-form articles.

Mint Daily.,"Problem - There are very few consumer dApps that are fun to use and not about speculation. BasePaint was conceived as an art project that could only be built on web3, where artists could collaborate onchain and share in the profits generated by their collective work.

Creation - Every day since our launch (08.09.2023) artists come together on BasePaint to paint a shared canvas for 24 hours. Once the 24 hours passes, the artwork is minted as an open edition NFT, and the profits are distributed amongst all contributors.

Impact - Over 2,203 artists, many using Base for the first time, have contributed to over 64 CC0 canvases, generating $230k in profits distributed frictionlessly between all contributors.

What is addrs?
addrs is a platform that allows users to create payment profiles containing all of their cryptocurrency addresses in one place, making it easier to send and receive cryptocurrency. When someone clicks on the link, their wallet will open with your address automatically entered, eliminating the need to manually input long addresses. Any ETH wallet. addrs is a non-custodial platform, meaning that we do not hold onto your cryptocurrency or private keys.

Nest has been around for a while, but I’ve been hesitant to get one. I won’t go into the details of why we finally pulled the trigger, but it made sense to have more control of our home environment.

When the box arrived, I was excited. I felt like I was stepping into the future. Once I got it all wired up and began the setup, though, my original hesitation came flooding back.

Nest would like to use your location.

I almost bailed. This is when Nest stopped feeling like a fun, helpful device and started to feel like an intrusive portal. Yet another keyhole for a company (or whomever else) to peer into my family’s life. It was probably okay, I rationalized. It’s probably just sharing location and temperature data, I thought to myself.

Taxman was built in BanklessDAO, a landing place for new web3 contributors.  One of the biggest surprises facing new contributors is the tax liability they take on when accepting tokens for their work. The 2021 tax season was especially bad, as token prices fell by 80-90%, leaving contributors with a hefty, surprise tax bill and reduced ability to pay.  Many contributors walked away from the space entirely.

To solve this, Taxman allows anyone to calculate their DAO income taxes in their own fiat currency in 10 minutes.  DAO contributors can set aside taxes as they earn, avoiding a surprise tax bill, giving them piece of mind to continue contributing to they web3 projects they love.","[{""type"":""GITHUB_REPO"",""url"":""https://github.com/Bankless-Card/bcard-taxman-wireframe"",""description"":""Github repo of the website""},{""type"":""OTHER"",""url"":""https://taxman.banklesscard.xyz/"",""description"":""Live Taxman website""}]","[""END_USER_EXPERIENCE_AND_ADOPTION""]","Taxman helped many DAO contributors (especially at BanklessDAO) calculate their tax liability while they earned, reducing stress during tax season.

Progressing the distributed movement!,"Adding IPFS support in CURL took 506 days (see contribution PR link) which landed in the 8.4.0 release. Available as of Oct 11th 2024.

This contribution is two-fold.

1. It allows a user to set an IPFS gateway to use for IPFS URLs (ipfs:// and ipns://). If a local node is installed and running, curl will try and find it's configured gateway without any additional user configuration.

2. It translates IPFS URLs internally to the defined (or detected) gateway thus giving the user a smooth IPFS usage experience without them ever seeing the gateway part of a URL.

These additions to CURL make it accept the IPFS URLs without the need to prefix them with a gateway (a central point of entry).","[{""type"":""OTHER"",""url"":""https://github.com/curl/curl/pull/8805"",""description"":""PR""}]","""END_USER_EXPERIENCE_AND_ADOPTION""], [""DEVELOPER_ECOSYSTEM""","Previously users had to specify an IPFS URL like this:
curl https://ipfs.io/ipfs/bafybeigagd5nmnn2iys2f3doro7ydrevyr2mzarwidgadawmamiteydbzi

That defines a central point of entry (the https://ipfs.io). Ideally you want the user to specify just the IPFS parts, the gateway needs to be a configuration. The changes made in curl 8.4.0 do exactly that. Users can now use an IPFS URL like this:
curl ipfs://bafybeigagd5nmnn2iys2f3doro7ydrevyr2mzarwidgadawmamiteydbzi

The gateway is effectively reduced to a configuration detail. Users of curl now don't need to share the gateway anymore and can instead use plain simple IPFS URLs.

CURL is estimated to be installed at ~20 billion places making this a potential huge impact for IPFS adoption and another step in a more distributed world.","[{""description"":""Downloads (billions!)"",""number"":20000000000,""url"":""https://curl.se/""}]",[],0xF03214714ddc99856eB9301D2c945195974064da,https://content.optimism.io/rpgf3Application/v0/metadata/10/0xF03214714ddc99856eB9301D2c945195974064da.json,0xF03214714ddc99856eB9301D2c945195974064da,10,null,markg85,Developer_Ecosystem,Dev Tooling,,

By training these 20 people to learn Solidity for free, B<>rder/ess tech hub is providing a valuable resource to the community and helping to build a stronger foundation for the future of Optimism.

Here are some specific ways that B<>rder/ess developers programme benefits the Optimism ecosystem:

Increase the number of developers building on Optimism:

The more developers who know Solidity, the more applications and protocols can be built on Optimism.

Improve the quality of smart contracts on Optimism:

Our training has some immediate impact for the Optimism ecosystem.

For example, the 20 people who complete their training will be able to start contributing to the Optimism ecosystem right away by building new applications and protocols, or by auditing existing code.

Here are some specific ways that our students contribute to the Optimism ecosystem:

1. Build new applications and protocols on Optimism

2. Audit existing smart contracts on Optimism for security vulnerabilities.
We also teach Cyber Security at B<>rder/ess so this would help web3 devs learn faster on securing vulnerabilities.

3. Educate others about Solidity and Optimism through blog posts, tutorials, and workshops.

Smart-contract finished development on Optimism: 

(1) QuantumFair uses Beacon Proxy contract using MCP in the entry point contract.

(2) The user opens the contract and locks the assets in the dynamic vault.

(3) With the contract in an open state, then users can register themselves as participants by paying or not a specified fee in ETH or a predefined ERC20 token.

(4) After the time is over, the raffle is set to close. The contract makes a call to the Airnode through our requester contract to choose the winner.

(5)Lastly, we retrieve the results and wrap the raffle contract in a finished state.

Debugging smart contracts was a huge pain for smart contract engineers back in 201x era. 

Solution: 

A hardhat plugin called ""hardhat-tracer"" has made debugging smart contracts on hardhat easier by allowing the developer to see the call tree with parsed calldata/returndata along with events, storage ops, and more EVM opcodes while running the tests. It also gives programmatic access to the trace information for writing more advanced tests.

Users who want censorship-resistant, private, cheap, and fast access to unquestionably accurate chain data–free of any intermediaries and their direct or indirect costs–use TrueBlocks' local-first software.

TrueBlocks uniquely enables Optimism and Ethereum users of all types to:

- Build complete indexes as it looks for “every appearance of every address on the blockchain,”
- Access pre-built indexes via IPFS and TrueBlocks’ Unchained Index smart contracts, which cheaply and equitably share the index for the public good,
- Retrieve their on-chain data directly, cheaply, and quickly with consumer-grade hardware.

- Does not compromise on Optimism's nor Web 3.0’s core values of decentralization, open access, and data sovereignty.
- Helps reduce the community’s reliance on web 2.0-like data intermediaries that put us at risk of censorship, user capture, privacy invasion, and rent-seeking,
- Expands the utility of the node software, giving users another reason to run a node, thereby promoting decentralization,
- Inspires node enhancement via EIP proposals and demonstrates how true decentralization can work,
- Better insulate the entire community from regulatory overreach.

For instance, two leading perpetual protocols that use Pyth on Arbitrum: Vela Exchange and HMX, have launched OP markets thanks to the Pyth Price Feed.","[{""type"":""CONTRACT_ADDRESS"",""url"":""https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0xff1a0f4744e8582df1ae09d5611b887b6a12925c"",""description"":""Pyth Optimism Smart Contract""},{""type"":""GITHUB_REPO"",""url"":""https://github.com/pyth-network/pyth-sdk-solidity"",""description"":""Pyth Network Github Repo""},{""type"":""OTHER"",""url"":""https://pyth.network/blog/pyth-launches-price-oracles-on-ethereum-and-optimism"",""description"":""Pyth deployment on Optimism""},{""type"":""OTHER"",""url"":""https://pyth.network/consumers?blockchain=optimism"",""description"":""Pyth Users on Optimism""},{""type"":""OTHER"",""url"":""https://youtu.be/UAFR4c4-DPk?si=ASu5Fn513fXNWsje"",""description"":""Synthetix Case Study Video""}]","[""DEVELOPER_ECOSYSTEM""]","Since deploying on Optimism, the Pyth oracle has become the go-to infrastructure for anyone building DeFi that requires low-latency data — apart from PERP Protocol, all derivatives platform live on Optimism have become #PoweredByPyth ; this amount to close to 99% market share on that segment.

The creation of DAOs via Builder on OP brings users that are familiar with and engaged in collective governance across the web3 ecosystem. Additionally, as many engaged in the DAO space are technical founders or contributors this engages those already part of the developer ecosystem to interact and build on the OP chain.

The ease of use of Builder Protocol to launch DAOs on OP greatly enhances the end user experience which helps to create a effortless pathway to seamless adoption bringing new users to the collective.

This is achieved through our auto-compounding wrapper (wBLT), which is transferable. Our native protocol liquidity is wBLT-BMX, demonstrating that wBLT can be paired with any asset and continue to earn wBLT rewards. wBLT can also be collateralized. LPing is inherently complex, to support user education, we intentionally named our liquidity after a sandwich, for the meme and for the concept of multiple ingredients (assets) combined to form one sandwich (token).

This means public goods funding is a critical growth strategy. For Optimism, well-funded public goods means better developer tooling, widespread user education, safer infrastructure, and industry-leading research. It means Optimism can last and thrive.

Our weekly Learn to Earn quests encouraged participants to learn a different protocol every week in the broader OP ecosystem.  The learning topics included protocols in the defi, NFTs, bridges, wallets, onramp, and tools categories. The program produced around 400 power users of the Optimism ecosystem.

We were also invited by Coinbase to produce an artwork that was featured as part of the Coinbase wallet quests. This initiative provided a large net positive in helping onboard 25,000 Coinbase Wallet users onto Optimism, creating a positive impact on the entire Optimism system.

The script lets you configure and run your own rollup by running only two or three commands. It uses a single well-documented config file.

Additionally, it supports EIP-4337 AA infrastructure (bundler + paymaster) and helps you automatically subsidize gas for transactions that match certain criteria.

Spinning a rollup on Goerli is as simple as:

> git clone git@github.com:0xFableOrg/roll-op.git
> cd roll-op
> cp conf.toml.example conf.toml
# conf.toml: uncomment Goerli section, add your keys & rpc
> ./rollop setup --yes

I am dedicated to advancing Optimism as a cost-effective, secure Ethereum alternative. Focusing on the badge collective, Ve(3,3) models like Velodrome, and community governance, I've worked to onboard individuals onto the crypto network since 2018. Working closely with @FA40Ziv, as one of only two moderators in his Discord community, I've guided both new and experienced members, making Optimism accessible to all.

As a devoted father of a newborn, I'm driven to promote scalable solutions in the blockchain space. The Optimism network's OP Mainnet, built by Ethereum developers, provides a fast, stable, and cost-effective L2 blockchain. Its EVM-equivalent architecture ensures seamless scalability for Ethereum applications. I believe this is the future!

Firmly believing that true impact arises from active involvement, I continuously encourage the members within Discord to take part in governance. By sharing direct links to votes and urging everyone to appoint delegates, I've strived to create an atmosphere of genuine participation.

This isn't merely about holding tokens, but rather, about wielding influence and shaping Optimism's trajectory collectively.

Union is a private community with 600 people paying participation fees on a monthly basis. So the most interested target audience but I'm unable to give you links since it's a private community

Academy is an information product. There's also a target audience with money that we're teaching from scratch how to interact with the Web3 world. Same with links as it is in Union

Youtube channel: 197k+
Telegram channel: 72k+

Our blog posts and podcasts were collected on Optimism via Mirror and Spinamp. 

We’re the only media outlet in onchain music that created Optimism content consistently. 

We helped artists navigate the L2 space, guiding them through the grant and retro applications.

Invest in Music is one of the top drivers of mints to music on Optimism - we referred more than 200 mints across 76 unique songs.

We’re the 4th largest curator on Sound.xyz

We launched an Optimism Onchain Curator program - giving our community 1000 OP per month for driving mints, volume, artists, and content on Optimism.

We used podcasts, blogs, and newsletters to explain complex things around Optimism. We showed how Optimism could solve real problems for Africans with simple examples. We translated important optimism content to Pidgin so more people could understand.

We also educated and inspired Pidgin speakers to use Optimism and its tech. We talked about how to use OP tokens, join communities, and more. Our goal was to include everyone and make sure Pidgin speakers felt confident using Optimism and participating in the collective.

I'm launching a real estate investment opportunity leveraging my 20 years of experience building homes with my father. Together, we bring over 40 years of expertise in crafting custom homes.

We're seeking $500-650K USD to:
1.) Purchase land
2.) Construct the home
3.) Furnish it

Once completed, the property joins our rental program, generating income for investors. With our housing background, investors should recoup their investment by year 5.

Afterward, we sell the home and share the profits. Investors can also use the property, akin to a timeshare but without pesky fees. This property pays you back over time, and we never charge maintenance fees.","[{""type"":""OTHER"",""url"":""https://twitter.com/Digital3states"",""description"":""Not much info out yet but discord is where all the info will be shared..""}]","[""END_USER_EXPERIENCE_AND_ADOPTION""]","To be honest i'm still looking for a chain to launch this business.

Coordination
We have been practising social coordination at scale since 2021. For the bDAO Optimism Global Campaign, we coordinate nodes from 11 languages to promote the creation and shipping of content, as well as reporting and accounting for them.
Additionally we coordinated with Bankless Academy to ship translation of their OP lesson in 5 languages.
Content Creation
Nodes are independent entities stewarded by local teams and have submitted their own applications. However Chinese and Tamil nodes were unable to submit their own applications due various reasons so we would like to report stats on their behalf.","[{""type"":""OTHER"",""url"":""https://twitter.com/IMNbankless"",""description"":""IMN twitter account""},{""type"":""OTHER"",""url"":""https://twitter.com/BanklessCN"",""description"":""Bankless CN twitter account""},{""type"":""OTHER"",""url"":""https://www.instagram.com/bankless_tamil/"",""description"":""Bankless Tamil instagram account""}]","""OP_STACK""], [""COLLECTIVE_GOVERNANCE""","From coordination side:
The Optimism collective was able to market its vision and values to a global community which generated 29,640 views in 11 languages, through 191 pieces of translated content including Newsletter, twitter threads and youtube videos.

Our contribution is our work in the forum and the documentation of this pilot project. The backbone consists of 15 community governance calls with 514 attendees who voted on 233 financial, organizational, and operational decisions.

Beyond this, we promoted governance topics at online and IRL events, notably #GovernanceDay organized by SEED Latam (Buenos Aires, 2023), attracting 200 attendees with 3 talks on Public Goods and Optimism Governance.","[{""type"":""OTHER"",""url"":""https://mirror.xyz/seedlatam.eth/KMHntv3I3vQzK7wxaP5h9ahNsZmvJnAnGPV3XwYd50c"",""description"":""The Social Consensus of SEED Latam""},{""type"":""OTHER"",""url"":""https://mirror.xyz/seedlatam.eth/sTOUNZCmGQnaHcdHv-FikhKObuJDr7rJvzfRsswNH4o"",""description"":""Impact Report of Optimism on the SEED Latam Community""},{""type"":""OTHER"",""url"":""https://mirror.xyz/seedlatam.eth/qZNP6qoSi5E5DYYCursYgWCiwCbPQH9feif6ZvtG8Gs"",""description"":""SEED Latam's design, identity, and visual communication for Optimism""},{""type"":""OTHER"",""url"":""https://www.youtube.com/live/uHqSdKL7XZ0?si=8HTd-9h8y8h6jZq0"",""description"":""Playlist Optimism Governance Calls""},{""type"":""OTHER"",""url"":""https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhTCvqIxiz5xvrL8npWbe5Sh-S1qoUKZ-&si=lTl2yK6UQUSbQPel"",""description"":""Aula Abierta - Introductory Cycle on Governance""},{""type"":""OTHER"",""url"":""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AqvRyIVLS8&list=PLhTCvqIxiz5wxW4fe0-WSIJ7qVIo0vQWa&index=6"",""description"":""#GovernanceDay: Gonna - Discovering the Future of Public Goods on Optimism (ES)""},{""type"":""OTHER"",""url"":""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgqQXsYGch0&list=PLhTCvqIxiz5wxW4fe0-WSIJ7qVIo0vQWa&index=7"",""description"":""#GovernanceDay: Pumbi - The Future of Optimism Governance (ES)""},{""type"":""OTHER"",""url"":""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyRaaq-nTPg&list=PLhTCvqIxiz5wxW4fe0-WSIJ7qVIo0vQWa&index=8"",""description"":""#GovernanceDay: Joxes - Deciphering Governance in Ethereum Rollups""}]","[""COLLECTIVE_GOVERNANCE""]","We believe that community delegation positively influenced Optimism's forum, both in terms of quantity and quality.

The impact of these tools is that members of these web3 communities are more actively engaged onchain compared to web2.

Many users have used our tools resulting in on-chain actions on Base Network. Actions like minting a username, minting posts, sending tokens, etc.

While our contributions are in their early stage we can see our impact through on-chain metrics:

- Registering a username (web3 domain name).
- Minting posts as NFTs (this is how users can reward or tip creators of great posts).
- Creating your own NFT via NFT Launchpad (separate from post NFTs, users can also launch their own NFT collections through the NFT Launchpad).

So well i guess my contribution might be more on a symbolic level, but in the beginning of 2023 when i thought a lot about which L2 to use i went for Optimism because at that time there was mainly the choice between Arbitrum, Optimism and the sort-of L2 Polygon PoS. Arbitrum seemed very DeFi focused, Optimism had at least a NFT marketplace even though with obviously little real use.
And there is this NFT tool platform decent.xyz which supported Optimism. At that time more or less the only platform. It felt a bit lonely at that time with Optimism music NFTs, not many others existed.  Mint success was negligible, but well still fun.
Because it ofc is also somehow exciting to be an early user of something.

Measurable that is. But after the open-up and Optimism support i also deployed music NFTs with sound.xyz and manifold.xyz.
So why apply here?  I'm one of the users and creators of the Optimism blockchain. Many Dapps often lack users.  Many wallets tbh have still poor Optimism support.
I would want more users to apply, because they are in the end what the Optimism blockchain exists for.  And if there is a symbolic grant or not, isn't even the point.
It's nice that Optimism helped to save gas fees otherwise there wouldn't be any reason to use it, i think this is obvious.","[{""description"":""no not ryl many but overall positive"",""number"":0,""url"":""https://twitter.com/search?q=optimism%20(from%3Aglbkst)&src=typed_query""}]",[],0x46642e15d77BbE0bDfcfbf348C38b06153D16049,https://content.optimism.io/rpgf3Application/v0/metadata/10/0x46642e15d77BbE0bDfcfbf348C38b06153D16049.json,0x46642e15d77BbE0bDfcfbf348C38b06153D16049,10,glbkst,null,,,,

As part of this work, we've deployed smart contracts such as ZK SBT proof smart contracts, a large anonymity set, example issuers in rust, a DeSci identity registry, and privacy relayer contract.","[{""type"":""OTHER"",""url"":""https://app.holonym.id"",""description"":""Live ZK DID Application in Production""},{""type"":""OTHER"",""url"":""https://verse.opsci.io"",""description"":""DeSci Registry (built on OP with Holonym, WIP)""},{""type"":""OTHER"",""url"":""https://docs.holonym.id/"",""description"":""Documentation on Holonym""},{""type"":""GITHUB_REPO"",""url"":""https://github.com/holonym-foundation/example-issuer"",""description"":""Example Issuer for Devs""},{""type"":""CONTRACT_ADDRESS"",""url"":""https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0xb1f50c6c34c72346b1229e5c80587d0d659556fd"",""description"":""Holonym Relayer contract that adds user leaves to the Merkle Tree with privacy.""},{""type"":""CONTRACT_ADDRESS"",""url"":""https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0xdD748977BAb5782625AF1466F4C5F02Eb92Fce31"",""description"":""Holonym Sybil Resistance (GovID) ZK SBT and proof verification contract""},{""type"":""CONTRACT_ADDRESS"",""url"":""https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x7a81f2f88b0ee30ee0927c9f672487689c6dd7ce"",""description"":""Holonym Sybil Resistance (GovID) ZK SBT (ERC721)""},{""type"":""CONTRACT_ADDRESS"",""url"":""https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0xA40C8AAF7F47B18c1eDdBe7855b580f828eD9711"",""description"":""Holonym Sybil Resistance (Phone) ZK SBT and proof verification contract""},{""type"":""CONTRACT_ADDRESS"",""url"":""https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0xe337ad5aa1cb84e12a7aab85aed1ab6cb44c4a8e"",""description"":""Holonym Sybil Resistance (Phone) ZK SBT (ERC721)""},{""type"":""CONTRACT_ADDRESS"",""url"":""https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x7497636F5E657e1E7Ea2e851cDc8649487dF3aab"",""description"":""Holonym US Residence ZK SBT and proof verification contract""},{""type"":""CONTRACT_ADDRESS"",""url"":""https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x25b42489b7647863918af127aaaa3243ec605aca"",""description"":""Holonym US Residence ZK SBT (ERC721)""},{""type"":""CONTRACT_ADDRESS"",""url"":""https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x71712Ac158C5b25519Aad43eB9f496ae16892211"",""description"":""Holonym Medical Specialty ZK SBT and proof verification contract""},{""type"":""CONTRACT_ADDRESS"",""url"":""https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0xb316940b687DAa87392157e2ECfeC1b9e182423d"",""description"":""Holonym Merkle Tree Roots Contract (for censorship resistance)""},{""type"":""CONTRACT_ADDRESS"",""url"":""https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x87b6e03b0d57771940d7cc9e92531b6217364b3e"",""description"":""Holonym Hub Contract (deprecated)""},{""type"":""CONTRACT_ADDRESS"",""url"":""https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0xcA652a621aA40525698510b5C6cf4882df9891EB"",""description"":""OpSci Verse DeSci Identity Attestations""},{""type"":""GITHUB_REPO"",""url"":""https://github.com/holonym-foundation/holonym-relayer"",""description"":""Holonym Relayer Server""},{""type"":""GITHUB_REPO"",""url"":""https://github.com/holonym-foundation/id-hub-contracts"",""description"":""Holonym ID Hub Contracts""},{""type"":""GITHUB_REPO"",""url"":""https://github.com/holonym-foundation/zk-frontend"",""description"":""Holonym ZK Front End""},{""type"":""GITHUB_REPO"",""url"":""https://github.com/holonym-foundation/issuer-rust"",""description"":""Holonym ZK Issuer [rust]""},{""type"":""GITHUB_REPO"",""url"":""https://github.com/holonym-foundation/id-server"",""description"":""Holonym ZK ID server""}]","""END_USER_EXPERIENCE_AND_ADOPTION""], [""DEVELOPER_ECOSYSTEM""","The Holonym protocol has provided the following impact:

1. Integration of OP Mainnet across ShapeShift's open-source stack in February 2023. 

2. Implementation of an OP Growth Grant (Cycle 11) for a novel incentive program executed in partnership with Gitcoin Passport and Thrivecoin. A no-sale rule was implemented by the Growth Council starting in Cycle 10, and ShapeShift DAO therefore shouldered all building costs associated with this program to support the End User Experience & Adoption of Optimism.

2. Self-Service Model: Full autonomy and contract ownership for creators.
3. Reliability & Security: 99.99% uptime with a bot-resistant system.
4. Customizable Tools: Tailored minting rules and whitelists.

With about 3,000 NFT projects launched on Optimism, we're steadfast in broadening the ecosystem, championing accessible NFT creation in line with the Optimistic Vision.","[{""type"":""OTHER"",""url"":""https://apetimism.com/launchpad"",""description"":""Website""}]","""END_USER_EXPERIENCE_AND_ADOPTION"", ""OP_STACK""], [""DEVELOPER_ECOSYSTEM""","As the Optimism Collective embraced Superchain, our Launchpad expanded from serving only Optimism to all OP stack blockchains.

Our goal: anticipate the rise of NFTs and eliminate technical barriers. Thus, we support blockchains like Base, Zora, and Base Goerli.

Impacts:
- NFT Owners: We offer a streamlined platform, lowering entry hurdles.
  
- Chain Owners: While creating blockchains is eased by OP stack, developing an ecosystem isn't. Our Launchpad bridges this gap, enhancing business opportunities.

- OP Stack: As a ""Superchain-compatible"" launchpad, we rapidly onboard new chains, showcasing OP stack's ecosystem readiness and competitive edge.

In sum, Apetimism Launchpad enhances accessibility and growth, aligning with the Optimistic Vision and shaping the digital frontier.","[{""description"":""Number of projects created on Optimism"",""number"":2824,""url"":""https://apetimism.com/launchpad""},{""description"":""Number of projects created on Base"",""number"":169,""url"":""https://apetimism.com/launchpad""},{""description"":""Number of projects created on BaseGoerli"",""number"":48214,""url"":""https://apetimism.com/launchpad""},{""description"":""# Smart contracts deployed on Optimism"",""number"":125,""url"":""https://apetimism.com/launchpad""},{""description"":""# Smart contracts deployed on Base"",""number"":67,""url"":""https://apetimism.com/launchpad""},{""description"":""Number of NFTs minted on Optimism"",""number"":65003,""url"":""https://apetimism.com/launchpad""},{""description"":""Number of NFTs minted on Base"",""number"":56192,""url"":""https://apetimism.com/launchpad""}]","[{""type"":""RETROPGF_2"",""currency"":""OP"",""amount"":13769.49,""description"":""""},{""type"":""REVENUE"",""currency"":""USD"",""amount"":2300,""description"":""""}]",0xCA29F50c585b8dB702c9728D7B2b7F54F8ffA8bB,https://content.optimism.io/rpgf3Application/v0/metadata/10/0xF0974C239B7d08b7240b690B69EC3dD8aE783EFC.json,0xF0974C239B7d08b7240b690B69EC3dD8aE783EFC,10,nuuneoieth,null,End_User_Experience_Adoption,"Applications (Defi, Gaming Etc), NFTs, Social",,

The protocol is trustless, and immutable.

Chronicle labs, formerly the Maker Oracle team, along with the Maker Protocol Engineering team developed a native DAI bridge named ""Teleport"" in 2022. The infrastructure allowed for ""fast withdrawals"" of DAI from L2 to L1 for the first time. The first deployments went live on Optimism and Arbitrum in November 2022 allowing Optimism users to transfer DAI from L2 to L1 instantaneously. Teleport utilized off-chain Oracle Feeds to communicate between L1 and L2, providing cross chain communication messaging. Significant engineering time and resources (6 months/1,920 hours) from the Chronicle Oracle team contributed to the development of the first, trustless Dai bridge, providing users with the advantage to withdraw L2 funds near instantly by avoiding the need to wait for fraud proofs.

- Created a place for builders to share updates on their projects and get rewarded away from the noise of social media, and without the pressure of large crowdfunding, grants or VCs.

On-Chain Features:
- We've implemented an on-chain 'believe' functionality, as well as the ability to collect NFTs. All NFTs are on the optimism blockchain and have attribute tags, the tags build reputation onchain for being early.","[{""description"":""#of builders"",""number"":41,""url"":""https://radarlaunch.app/""},{""description"":""#$ to incentivise public building"",""number"":20000,""url"":""https://radarlaunch.app/""},{""description"":""#of unique site viewers"",""number"":1500,""url"":""https://radarlaunch.app/""},{""description"":""#of free event attendees"",""number"":400,""url"":""https://radarlaunch.app/""},{""description"":""#number of partners"",""number"":5,""url"":""https://radarlaunch.app/""},{""description"":""#of public Future Report readers"",""number"":10000,""url"":""https://www.radardao.xyz/""}]","[{""type"":""REVENUE"",""currency"":""USD"",""amount"":10000,""description"":""NFT Sales to fund our last research""},{""type"":""REVENUE"",""currency"":""USD"",""amount"":15000,""description"":""Ticket sales for Into The Future""}]",0x149D46eC060e75AE188876AdB6b24024637003C7,https://content.optimism.io/rpgf3Application/v0/metadata/10/0x149D46eC060e75AE188876AdB6b24024637003C7.json,0x149D46eC060e75AE188876AdB6b24024637003C7,10,Radarxyz,null,Developer_Ecosystem,"Conferences, Events & Hackathons",,

We also deployed all the infrastructure needed by communities to launch the same economic model the TEC has (the ABC), without the need for a developer. Optimism is now the only network where this no-code solution can be used.

Frame ships with both Optimism and Base as default chains. As a Base launch partner, we provided users with access to both Base Goerli and Base Mainnet from day one.

We also support both Optimism and Base via Pylon, our new infrastructure initiative which services a large and growing number of requests to OP chains every month.

E2PG is an open source Ethereum to Postgres indexer. It connects to an Ethereum source, parses blocks, transactions, and logs and maps data onto PG tables. A single E2PG can index events across many L2s into a single Postgres database. E2PG connects to Ethereum by 1 of 3 ways: JSON RPC API, full node file system (fast), or using RLPS (slower than full node but faster than JSON RPC).

RLPS is an HTTP API that delivers compressed RLP data for: blocks, transactions, and logs designed specifically for indexers. Index Supply hosted RLPS runs on many chains including the following OP L2s: 10, 420, 8453, and 84531. Index Supply operates a full nodes (op-geth, op-node) for each hosted RLPS API.","[{""type"":""GITHUB_REPO"",""url"":""https://github.com/indexsupply/x"",""description"":""Main E2PG/RLPS Repository""},{""type"":""OTHER"",""url"":""https://10.rlps.indexsupply.net"",""description"":""Optimism RLPS API""},{""type"":""OTHER"",""url"":""https://420.rlps.indexsupply.net"",""description"":""Optimism Goerli RLPS API""},{""type"":""OTHER"",""url"":""https://8453.rlps.indexsupply.net"",""description"":""Base RLPS API""},{""type"":""OTHER"",""url"":""https://84531.rlps.indexsupply.net"",""description"":""Base Goerli API""},{""type"":""OTHER"",""url"":""https://twitter.com/indexsupply/status/1689406311501369345"",""description"":""Hosted RLPS Twitter Announcement""},{""type"":""OTHER"",""url"":""https://github.com/orgs/indexsupply/discussions/123"",""description"":""RLPS Announcement Post""},{""type"":""OTHER"",""url"":""https://github.com/orgs/indexsupply/discussions/122"",""description"":""E2PG Announcement Post""}]","[""DEVELOPER_ECOSYSTEM""]","E2PG has enabled several projects (popular NFT websites, erc4337 wallet, MUD games) to index data across many OP L2 chains.

RLPS was one of the first hosted node providers for the bedrock release. Since then we've made it dead simple to boot up an E2PG indexer and have it be connected to Optimism and Base to start indexing data across those chains. To my knowledge, E2PG + RLPS is the quickest way to get data from multiple L2 chains into a Postgres database.

Using Llama, organizations on Optimism can deploy fully independent instances that define granular roles and permissions for executing transactions, known as ""actions"".

Llama instances can adapt to a changing environment by incrementally adding new participants and expanding the set of available actions. Actions include transferring funds, updating a registry, changing protocol parameters, or activating an emergency pause.

Llama's onchain framework is open and permissionless: any org on Optimism can deploy a self-governed Llama instance to create and execute onchain actions.

Since November 2021, Covalent has served as a key data infrastructure provider for Optimism, indexing OP Mainnet, OP Sepolia, OP Goerli, four OP Chains (Base, Zora, Public Goods Network, Mode), and six OP Stack Forks (opBNB, Mantle, Metis, Boba, Kinto, Loot Chain).

Our Unified API provides transparency and visibility into assets across all supported OP Stack chains, while Increment serves as a BI Tool, enabling visualization of data and the extraction of valuable insights.

This allows developers and analysts to save time and resources and lets them focus on building applications and conducting analyses without worrying about the complexities of onchain data

Track historical/real-time events, store for querying.
Stream events to a Kafka topic.

We're accomplishing this by rewarding contributions to the greater good through Retroactive Public Goods Funding–the mechanism used to reward past demonstrable positive impact to the Optimism Collective.","[{""description"":""https://twitter.com/mamsky8619"",""number"":1,""url"":""https://twitter.com/mamsky8619""}]","[{""type"":""GOVERNANCE_FUND"",""currency"":""OP"",""amount"":16.64,""description"":""i contributed on web3 such as Defillama, Privx, Synpress, Mirror and Revoke.cash""}]",0x3c28CAEF950AE11973A007440929d0689d8eaD8D,https://content.optimism.io/rpgf3Application/v0/metadata/10/0x3c28CAEF950AE11973A007440929d0689d8eaD8D.json,0x3c28CAEF950AE11973A007440929d0689d8eaD8D,10,mamsky8619,null,,,,

Every web3 project requires on-chain information. Inspired by BuildOnBase, we decided to create OpenIndexer.

2. Mirror Optimism NFT Tracker

We worked with Mirror to help track all of the subscriber + writing NFTs minted to collectors.

3. Friend.Tech Tooling Dashboards

Our team built out multiple dashboards to help Friend.Tech users trade/purchase new keys with sufficient data to avoid being scammed/rug pulled.","[{""type"":""GITHUB_REPO"",""url"":""https://github.com/Slice-Analytics/OpenIndexer"",""description"":""OpenIndexer""},{""type"":""OTHER"",""url"":""https://dune.com/mirror_xyz/mirror-project-creator-dashboard"",""description"":""Mirror Optimism NFT Tracker Dashboard""},{""type"":""OTHER"",""url"":""https://dune.com/sliceanalytics/friendtech"",""description"":""Friend.Tech Public Tools Dashboard""},{""type"":""OTHER"",""url"":""https://dune.com/sliceanalytics/friendtech-slice-analytics"",""description"":""Friend.Tech TVL Tracker""},{""type"":""OTHER"",""url"":""https://dune.com/sliceanalytics/friendtech-alt-accounts?base_address_t9d7e6=0xb28443a211ed75d6ec76eeb43030dfa884f77cf0"",""description"":""Friend.Tech Alt Account Identifier (Used to avoid Scam Accounts)""},{""type"":""OTHER"",""url"":""https://gov.optimism.io/t/incentive-impact-analysis-stargate/7003"",""description"":""Incentive Analysis Stargate (Paid Job) - Use only as a reference for our work.""}]","""END_USER_EXPERIENCE_AND_ADOPTION""], [""DEVELOPER_ECOSYSTEM""","Our team has provided countless data driven insights/custom queries to companies, DAO's, and individuals in the crypto space.

Starting from the heuristic that the future of work will be digital. These entities need to coordinate among themselves and with humans. We are developing the tooling and ecosystem for builders to create new protocols and dapps on top of Stamp.

This has resulted in gas fee expenditure of  .116 ETH, bridging ≈10 ETH to the OP mainnet, and locking ≈4k USD in 2 OP chains until 2026.","[{""type"":""GITHUB_REPO"",""url"":""https://github.com/orgs/zenbitETH/repositories"",""description"":""Zenbit.eth OSS repositories""},{""type"":""CONTRACT_ADDRESS"",""url"":""https://goerli-optimism.etherscan.io/address/0x2204a410be3085cba25b8a71017cb7870519d76d#code"",""description"":""Faucet contract for onboarding events (Education)""},{""type"":""GITHUB_REPO"",""url"":""https://mirror.xyz/zenbit.eth"",""description"":""Zenbit Report in Mirror (spa & eng)""},{""type"":""CONTRACT_ADDRESS"",""url"":""https://goerli-optimism.etherscan.io/address/0xd2D9De2c40D1A49f7247165284cea27a1BEAa272#code"",""description"":""Quiz Contract for crosschain atestation (Education)""},{""type"":""OTHER"",""url"":""https://optimism-goerli-bedrock.easscan.org/schema/view/0x0d6ecbd5000b1713c21e28296f6ed8bfa8e0e5f5d8ee4b354276ba65c8b2c188"",""description"":""Crosschain attestation in Optimism Goerli (Education)""},{""type"":""OTHER"",""url"":""https://ccip.chain.link/msg/0x9be2f2e094403fa1527e72cfaf651a1b3757890fb0bd0bdea3258ef7d7452ff3"",""description"":""Chainlink CCIP for crosschain attestation (Education)""},{""type"":""CONTRACT_ADDRESS"",""url"":""https://goerli-optimism.etherscan.io/address/0x82ddff634B673136d9dB515E9aFA8B2F691e573c"",""description"":""Decentralized Commerce Store NFT contract (Urban Gaming)""},{""type"":""CONTRACT_ADDRESS"",""url"":""https://etherscan.io/tx/0x70f3c9c8d2565165adb0bf7a1d89d5f094d7c48f83ff5f81054be84d1c0cf88d"",""description"":""Value bridged to Optimism""},{""type"":""CONTRACT_ADDRESS"",""url"":""https://debank.com/profile/0xecb4c1245665e8a1f43826355aab0dd6bf336e05"",""description"":""Locked value in OP chains""},{""type"":""OTHER"",""url"":""https://zenbiteth.notion.site/7b78f741d22a45469326077e534865cc?v=33d54bf2e42949a7921541172fb897cf&pvs=4"",""description"":""zenbit.eth projects details""},{""type"":""OTHER"",""url"":""https://zenbiteth.notion.site/2f25b0f1e88c41abb6780242d4a1abc3?v=0acb684a9d2049ffa15174ea3f8455b0&pvs=4"",""description"":""zenbit.eth talent details""},{""type"":""OTHER"",""url"":""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lI2wMFjLR0Q&list=PLV3ZkoJsTJ_ngEF29jSSvgOVO9xG5iKTo"",""description"":""Digital Economy workshop 2020""}]","""END_USER_EXPERIENCE_AND_ADOPTION""], [""DEVELOPER_ECOSYSTEM""","- 21 members in zenbit discord server

ONBOARDING: For many users – either creators or receivers of hypercerts – these are their first transactions on Optimism. We have supported numerous users in our pilots to get OP and walked them through their first transactions.

USE CASE: We created a use case for Optimism strengthening the narrative for web3: You need to be in control of accounting for your contributions and the sale of impact – without a centralized platform.

PROJECTS: Projects account for contributions, raise funds and reward their supporters, e.g. Zuzalu received over 20 ETH.","[{""description"":""Hypercerts created"",""number"":38900,""url"":""https://dune.com/hypercerts/op-hypercerts""},{""description"":""Addresses That Have Created a Hypercert"",""number"":20674,""url"":""https://dune.com/hypercerts/op-hypercerts""},{""description"":""Hypercerts Created in Last 7 Days"",""number"":2081,""url"":""https://dune.com/hypercerts/op-hypercerts""},{""description"":""Hypercert owners (unique)"",""number"":30464,""url"":""https://dune.com/hypercerts/op-hypercerts""},{""description"":""Retroactive funding for Zuzalu (in ETH)"",""number"":21.1,""url"":""https://zuzalu.hypercerts.org""}]",[],0x560adA72a80b4707e493cA8c3B7B7528930E7Be5,https://content.optimism.io/rpgf3Application/v0/metadata/10/0xB6091aAb544eF253c23a37295953AaFc9D836681.json,0xB6091aAb544eF253c23a37295953AaFc9D836681,10,null,holkeb,Collective_Governance,Governance tooling,,

And with ~80% of our builders being new to crypto or more junior developers, we believe that TurboETH is not only increasing the number of active builders in the Optimism Collective, but also helping to retain developers in their transition from launching contracts to building applications.","[{""description"":""Integrations"",""number"":21,""url"":""https://github.com/turbo-eth/template-web3-app/tree/integrations/integrations""},{""description"":""CLI Monthly Downloads"",""number"":525,""url"":""https://npm-stat.com/charts.html?package=create-turbo-eth&from=2022-09-28&to=2023-09-28""},{""description"":""GitClones"",""number"":600,""url"":""https://github.com/turbo-eth/template-web3-app/graphs/traffic""},{""description"":""Github Stars"",""number"":233,""url"":""https://github.com/turbo-eth/template-web3-app""},{""description"":""Github Forks"",""number"":62,""url"":""https://github.com/turbo-eth/template-web3-app""},{""description"":""Discord Community"",""number"":165,""url"":""https://discord.com/invite/U4jy7Xfh76""},{""description"":""OP Bounties and Funding for builders"",""number"":9387,""url"":""https://optimistic.etherscan.io/advanced-filter?fadd=0x4B5509687117aE7308188753ECbAEd61B3B1233c&tadd=0x4B5509687117aE7308188753ECbAEd61B3B1233c&txntype=2&tkn=0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000042&__cf_chl_rt_tk=.d5I4cf577V3W7.BQLznI7ZC2ZQju8pHOtvQNdhVcmk-1696962684-0-gaNycGzNDbs""},{""description"":""USDC Bounties and Funding for builders"",""number"":1906,""url"":""https://etherscan.io/advanced-filter?fadd=0xfdA84CFC7D83d9D744590280289160F8118966E5&txntype=2&tkn=0xa0b86991c6218b36c1d19d4a2e9eb0ce3606eb48""}]","[{""type"":""RETROPGF_2"",""currency"":""OP"",""amount"":18271.88,""description"":""""},{""type"":""OTHER"",""currency"":""USD"",""amount"":774.95,""description"":""Gitcoin Grants Round 18""},{""type"":""OTHER"",""currency"":""USD"",""amount"":633.52,""description"":""Gitcoin OSS Beta Round""}]",0x4B5509687117aE7308188753ECbAEd61B3B1233c,https://content.optimism.io/rpgf3Application/v0/metadata/10/0x3417aD1d79D9508912E8d7f3B9167085500b12CE.json,0x3417aD1d79D9508912E8d7f3B9167085500b12CE,10,justinmbassey,0xJBass,Developer_Ecosystem,Dev Tooling,,

My efforts to onboard people started in 2021 via a small project called Mafia Creativa - a creative outreach and collective based on:
-free education and onboarding into web3
-leveraging creativity for the common good

We hosted numerous calls, twitter spaces and virtual events for crypto curious romanians. Back them public goods in web3 were synonimous with Gitcoin and Optimism so most of our calls were focused around that.

I've onboarded 5-10 high impact contributors to Optimism(one full time Gitcoin contributor, 2 ex Gitcoin contributors-grant reviewers, 1 romanian influencer with an audience of over 10k and 2 romanians that are active in web3-one works with Thrive coin and the other is launching a fashion label)

We've reached over 100 romanians that are active in web3.

As a non profit we consider that despite the lack of on-chain proofs of our impact on OC, our qualitative contribution to the whole space is significant enough to ask for a small grant (even 1000/2000 USD in OP value) in this RPF round and it would be a good support.","[{""description"":""Big events on bck and pgf delivered"",""number"":5,""url"":""https://crypto-commons.org/events-database""}]","[{""type"":""REVENUE"",""currency"":""USD"",""amount"":100000,""description"":""The amount indicated is the rough amount of revenues we had in 2022/2023 as CCA""},{""type"":""OTHER"",""currency"":""USD"",""amount"":0,""description"":""We didn't receive any funding from Optimism in any form so far""}]",0xb013701563Fe41358c9308C3020B8DDD71225CB8,https://content.optimism.io/rpgf3Application/v0/metadata/10/0xb013701563Fe41358c9308C3020B8DDD71225CB8.json,0xb013701563Fe41358c9308C3020B8DDD71225CB8,10,crypto4commons,null,Developer_Ecosystem,"Conferences, Events & Hackathons",,

First, we were one of the first major NFT collections to launch on Optimism and get traction. There are over 900 unique holders of our membership NFT. Many of which were new to Optimism and had to bridge funds to mint/buy the NFT on Optimism.

There's a healthy mix of some of the best founders in DeFi in our community as well as ""retail users"" from emerging markets. One of our main missions at Cryptotesters is to bridge the gap between users and founders.

Installing a chrome extension, or a mobile app to use a wallet is a big blocker for user onboarding. Instead, we should use modern standards like WebAuthn, Account Abstraction and create a SDK, which can be integrated into any website in a few lines of code.

WebAuthn is already available in all major browsers, including mobile browsers, like Safari on iOS and Chrome on Android. There is no approval necessary from authorities (Apple, Google, etc.) to use this new approach.

Users don't need to know anything about blockchain to do the onboarding using this approach.","[{""type"":""GITHUB_REPO"",""url"":""https://github.com/G7DAO/account-abstraction-webauthn"",""description"":""Repo for the project""},{""type"":""OTHER"",""url"":""https://web3-onboarding-example.game7.io"",""description"":""Demo for the new user onboarding flow""},{""type"":""CONTRACT_ADDRESS"",""url"":""https://goerli-optimism.etherscan.io/address/0xF5e93E83383CaBBC90aee394f2a9dB665ffE9eBd#code"",""description"":""Account Factory Contract for Account Abstraction (ERC-4337)""}]","""END_USER_EXPERIENCE_AND_ADOPTION""], [""DEVELOPER_ECOSYSTEM""","I don't have any past contributions on the Optimism Collective.
