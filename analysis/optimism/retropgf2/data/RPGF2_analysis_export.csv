What are Optinames?

Optinames are tradable and transferable sub-domains deployed on Optimism that are fully integrated with the Ethereum Name Service (ENS). They can be resolved on popular web3 wallets i.e Coinbase Wallet by utilizing an off-chain ENS resolver. 

We built the Optinames toolset to enable anyone to easily and cheaply create ENS subdomain-based communities.","- Developers can leverage our tools to create their own ENS communities on Optimism. One such project is ECC Name Service, the largest Optimism native ENS community with more than 3,797 unique users & over 19,132 names registered.

- The integration of Optinames by Coinbase Wallet has greatly increased the user-friendliness of transacting on Optimism, making it a more attractive option for users.","Optinames has previously been funded by the ENS Ecosystem working group via the monthly small grants competition as well as community contributions during the Gitcoin-grants alpha round.

- October 2022 ENS small grants competition (top 5 winners) - https://ensgrants.xyz/rounds/8 -  1 ETH.
- Gitcoin grants alpha round - community contributions - USD 4260.

","The Optinames core team is a diverse group based in Nairobi, Kenya comprised of:

Steve Gachau (stevegachau.eth), a back-end dev with extensive experience in solidity.

Hellen Stans (hellenstans.eth) is a seasoned product manager who has worked on several successful web3 projects.

Violah Matwaka (violah.eth) is a talented front-end dev with a passion for designing intuitive user interfaces.

It just barely covers my living costs, student loans etc. Any money I've made in crypto I've made by doing work for DAOs, writing for bounties, grants, and contests (I'm one of the most decorated winners of such programs for 2021/2022). Since the bear market began though, I've had almost no work.

In addition to being a marketplace, the protocol has a native token, $NFTE, and is building out the NFTEarth ""NFT Hub"" - which aims to server as a one-stop-shop for NFT creators, collectors, and DAOs looking to generate NFT art, deploy and manage contracts, and create allowlists as well as Mint embeds for their NFTs.","NFTs hold tremendous potential for on-boarding new users to web3 - especially on Layer2 networks like Optimism. NFTEarth chose to deploy on Optimism because there are already strong NFT communities that exist on the L2 network, but lack of a current sustainable marketplace that is dedicated to these communities like NFTEarth is.","NFTEarth currently is generating revenue through trading fees on the marketplace contract - which is currently set at 2.5%. In addition to this, the project has created multiple NFT collections itself which have raised around $5,000 $USD at this point in time. The only other source of funding at this time has been the incubation round from the Layer2DAO in early January, 2023 of 27,500 $OP tokens.",11,NFTEarth,True,0.4166666666666667,11.0,1.25,0x78ED254b9c140c1A2BE10d2ad32C65b5f712f54b,Contract (OP),,0.0,1.0,Tooling and utilities,Organization Repo,Contract (OP),0-1 years,Big Team (10+ ppl),Project > Github,Bursty
